Crossbreed heifers (n = 462, 346 ± 19 kg) were blocked by weight and randomly assigned to pens. Pens were assigned to 1 of 6 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design. Treatment 1 consisted of a combination of 54.6% steam-flaked corn (SFC), 30.0% wet corn gluten feed, 8.0% roughage, and supplement (0% flaxseed). In treatments 2 and 3, a proportion of SFC was replaced with 3 and 6% flaxseed, respectively; in treatments 4, 5, and 6, SFC was replaced with 2, 4, or 6% L-Flaxseed, respectively. Cattle were fed for 140 or 168 d and then harvested in a commercial abattoir where carcass data were collected. Approximately 24 h after harvest, carcasses were evaluated for 12th-rib fat thickness, KPH, LM area, marbling score, and USDA yield and quality grades. Samples of LM were also obtained for determination of long-chain fatty acid profiles. Cattle that were fed diets with 4 and 6% L-Flaxseed consumed less feed than other treatments (P < 0.05), which adversely affected ADG. Compared with cattle fed 0% flaxseed, cattle in these treatments had lower final BW (18 and 45 kg less for the 4 and 6% L-Flaxseed treatments, respectively), less ADG (0.16 and 0.48 kg/day less for the 4 and 6% L-Flaxseed treatments, respectively), and lower carcass weights, dressing percentages, LM areas, backfat thicknesses, and marbling scores (P < 0.05). The addition of flaxseed or 2% L-Flaxseed did not affect performance or carcass traits (P > 0.05). Supplementation with flaxseed increased (P < 0.05) the concentration of α-linolenic acid (ALA) in meat (0.173, 0.482, 0.743 mg/g for 0, 3, and 6% flaxseed, respectively). Furthermore, proportionate increases in the ALA content of muscle tissue were 47% greater when flaxseed was encapsulated within the dolomitic lime hydrate matrix (0.288, 0.433, 0.592 mg/g for 2, 4, and 6% L-Flaxseed, respectively). Both products showed a linear response in ALA concentration (R2 > 99%; increases for Flaxseed and L-Flaxseed of 0.095 and 0.140 mg of ALA/g of tissue for each percentage of flaxseed added). This study indicates that a matrix consisting of dolomitic lime hydrate is an effective barrier to ruminal biohydrogenation of PUFA; however, adverse effects on DMI limit the amounts that can be fed.'}, '_type': 'science', '_index': 'articulo-uach', '_id': '14', '_score': 1.0}, {'_source': {'published': 'AUG 2012', 'sourcedoc': 'Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology', 'title': ' Regional vegetation and climate changes during the last 13 kyr from a marine pollen record in Seno Reloncavi, southern Chile', 'author uach': 'Ana Abarzua', 'details': 'Volume: 181 Pages: 11-21', 'abstract': 'A marine pollen record from Seno Reloncaví (southern Chile, 41°S) illustrates temperate rainforest changes during the last 13 cal kyr BP. Our study shows the end of the last Termination at ~ 11.5–12 cal kyr BP coincident with the expansion of Weinmannia, illustrating disturbance and warming conditions, at the expense of cold-resistant conifers (Fitzroya–Pilgerodendron and Podocarpus). Warming conditions are strengthened at 10.7 cal kyr BP by the increase of heliophytic taxa (Eucryphia–Caldcluvia) characteristic of the Valdivian rainforest. These heliophytic taxa reach their maximum expansion between 9.6 and 7.4 cal kyr BP and point to warm and dry conditions during the Holocene Climatic Optimum. After 7.4 cal kyr BP, vegetation changes indicate variable climate conditions superimposed on a cooling trend associated with an increase in precipitation after ~ 6–5 cal kyr BP, shown by the expansion of the cold-resistant conifers. During the late Holocene, after 2.8 cal kyr BP, the continuous expansion of cold-resistant conifers marks an increase of cool and wet conditions. The comparison between marine and terrestrial pollen records highlights the similar trends and timing of vegetation changes which allows to complete the regional pattern of vegetation changes around Seno Reloncaví.

Two peripheral and four central populations were sampled along the Chilean coast and 113 haploid individuals were analyzed using 17 random amplification of polymorphic DNA loci. The genetic diversity was estimated by allele diversity (He), allele richness (Â), and the mean pair‐wise differences among multilocus genotypes. All three estimates consistently and significantly indicated a lower genetic diversity within the peripheral than within the central populations. Genetic differentiation between the two peripheral populations was stronger (FST=0.35) than between central populations at similar spatial scales (FST ranging from 0 to 0.25).

Consequently this practice is used to prevent foliar diseases of grapevines and rots of grapes. In this study, the effects of leaf removal on Cladosporium rot (Cladosporium cladosporioides and Cladosporium herbarum), which often affects ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ in Chile, were characterized. The effects of leaf removal on epiphytic populations of Cladosporium spp. on grape berry surfaces and on Cladosporium rot development were investigated. Three leaf removal treatments were compared: (i) severe leaf removal, where leaves from two to three nodes above, opposite and from all nodes below clusters were removed; (ii) mild leaf removal, where leaves opposite each cluster were removed; and (iii) no leaf removal. Regardless of the leaf removal treatment, low population levels of Cladosporium spp. were detected early in the ontogenic development of grape berries which increased as the berries matured, reaching maximum populations on overripe berries. Based on our results, severe leaf removal favors the growth of Cladosporium spp. on grape berries and increases the prevalence of Cladosporium rot at harvest. This increase in Cladosporium spp. was correlated with an increase in lenticel damage in ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ and ‘Sauvignon blanc’ vines subjected to severe leaf removal. Considering that Cladosporium rot significantly reduces yield and wine quality, farmers should avoid continuous exposure of grape clusters to sunlight in order to prevent severe outbreaks of Cladosporium rot.'}, '_type': 'science', '_index': 'articulo-uach', '_id': '10', '_score': 1.0}, {'_source': {'published': 'AUG 2007', 'sourcedoc': 'Plant Disease', 'title': ' Outbreaks of cladosporium rot associated with delayed harvest wine grapes in Chile.', 'author uach': 'Erika Briceno', 'details': 'Volume: 91 Issue: 8 Pages: 1060 ', 'abstract': 'Severe outbreaks of Cladosporium rot have occurred on berries in clusters of late harvest wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) during the 2003 to 2006 growing seasons. This disease was especially prevalent on Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) vineyards in central Chile where disease incidence commonly comprised 50 to 100% of the clusters at harvest. Symptoms appeared on mature grapes (total soluble solids [TSS] >22%) and were characterized by berry dehydration, a firm decay affecting a small portion of the berry and a superficial olive-green mold. Isolations made on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA) consistently yielded olive-green colonies after 7 days at 20°C. On the basis of colony morphology and morphological characteristics of conidiophores and conidia, Cladosporium herbarum (Pers.:Fr) Link and C. cladosporioides (Fres.) de Vries were identified (1). These species were primarily separated by the presence of rough and smooth conidial surfaces, respectively. Kochs postulates were completed by inoculating 80 wounded mature (20% TSS) CS berries and incubating them at 10, 20, and 30°C. An equal number of wounded but noninoculated berries were left as controls. Berries were surface sterilized (75% ethanol for 30 s and 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for 60 s), inoculated with 10 μl of a 106 conidial suspension per ml applied to the wounds made with a sterile hypodermic needle. Dark, necrotic lesions, 1 to 6 mm in diameter, and a dark mycelial colony appeared on the surface after 7 days in chambers with relative humidity of >95%. Disease incidence was significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by temperature, with 90, 100, and 49% of inoculated berries becoming infected when incubated at 10, 20, or 30°C, respectively. C. herbarum and C. cladosporioides appeared to be equally pathogenic, producing symptoms similar to naturally infected CS berries, and were reisolated (100%) on APDA. These same isolates were pathogenic when tested on mature (TSS >16%) Thompson Seedless (TS) berries. Fungicide sensitivity tests were performed on detached TS berries challenged by placing 10 μl of a 106 conidial suspension per ml of C. herbarum on injured berries. Boscalid (0.5 mg/ml, Cantus WG; BASF, Santiago, Chile), iprodione (0.5 mg/ml, Rovral WP; Bayer Crop Science, Santiago, Chile), pyraclostrobin (0.085 mg/ml, Comet SC; BASF), and pyraclostrobin (0.009 mg/ml) mixed with boscalid at 0.017 mg/ml (Bellis WG; BASF) provided a significant control (P < 0.05) with efficacy between 84.3 and 95.9%. Azoxystrobin (0.188 mg/ml, Quadris SC; Syngenta Crop Protection, Santiago, Chile), kresoxim methyl (0.067 mg/ml, Stroby SC; BASF), and trifloxystrobin (0.06 mg/ml, Flint WG; Bayer Crop Science) provided partial control with efficacy between 23.1 and 42.1%. Cladosporium spp. have been previously reported (2). However, severe outbreaks of Cladosporium rot occur when berries become partially senescent because of a considerable delay in harvest (3). This appears to favor the development of these pathogens.'}, '_type': 'science', '_index': 'articulo-uach', '_id': '12', '_score': 1.0}, {'_source': {'published': 'SEP 2012', 'sourcedoc': 'Quaternary Science Reviews', 'title': 'Postglacial vegetation, fire and climate dynamics at Central Chilean Patagonia (Lake Shaman, 44 degrees S)', 'author uach': 'Ana Abarzua', 'details': 'Volume: 50 Pages: 71-85', 'abstract': 'A 19 cal ka BP pollen and charcoal record from Lake Shaman (44°S; 71°W, Chile) was analyzed to establish vegetation, fire and climate dynamics of the forest-steppe ecotone in Central Chilean Patagonia. Lake Shaman record indicates that the upper Río Cisnes valley was free of ice at around 19 cal ka BP. From this date and until 14.8 cal ka BP, a grass steppe with high proportions of shrubs associated to colder and drier conditions than present developed in this area. A continuous increase of Nothofagus accompanied by a decline in the steppe shrubs and sudden dominance of paludal over aquatic plants from 11 cal ka BP was associated to effective moisture increase but still under modern values. The replacement of the cold-dry grass-shrub steppe by a similar-than-present forest-steppe ecotone suggests an increase in temperature indicating the onset of the Holocene. At the same time, moderate fire activity suggested by the charcoal record could be related to major fuel availability as consequence of Nothofagus forest expansion. Between 8 and 3 cal ka BP, the record indicates the easternmost position of the forest-steppe ecotone suggesting the highest effective moisture with the establishment of seasonality between 5 and 3 cal ka BP. From 3 cal ka BP, the record indicates a retraction of the forest-steppe ecotone accompanied by a high pollen record variability and an increased fire activity. These late changes suggest decreased effective moisture associated with a high climatic variability. At regional and extra-regional scale, climatic changes at Lake Shamans record are mostly associated to changes (latitudinal shifts and/or strengthening/weakening) of past Southern Westerlies that were previously recorded along Patagonia from the Lateglacial to the mid-Holocene. During the Late Holocene, a regional pattern characterized by high record variability emerges throughout Central Chilean Patagonia.

Calibration equations were developed by modified partial least squares regression, and tested by cross‐validation. Standard error of cross validation (SECV) and coefficient of determination of cross validation (inline image) were used to select best equations. Equations with good predicting accuracy were obtained for DM, CF, CP, GE and fat.

Additional studies were conducted to evaluate these host plant volatiles and acetic acid in combination with the sex pheromone, ( E,E )-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol (codlemone). Traps baited with pear ester/nonatriene + acetic acid placed within orchards treated either with codlemone dispensers or left untreated caught significantly more males, females, and total moths than similar traps baited with pear ester + acetic acid in some assays. Similarly, traps baited with codlemone/pear ester/nonatriene + acetic acid caught significantly greater numbers of moths than traps with codlemone/pear ester + acetic acid lures in some assays in orchards treated with combinational dispensers (dispensers loaded with codlemone/pear ester). These data suggest that monitoring of codling moth can be marginally improved in orchards under variable management plans using a binary host plant volatile lure in combination with codlemone and acetic acid. These results are likely to be most significant in orchards treated with combinational dispensers. Significant increases in the catch of female codling moths in traps with the binary host plant volatile blend plus acetic acid should be useful in developing more effective mass trapping strategies'})\n",

The combination of the sex pheromone of both species (PH combo lure) significantly increased G. molesta and marginally decreased C. pomonella captures as compared with captures of each species with either of their sex pheromones alone. The addition of a HPV combination lure [(E,Z)‐2,4‐ethyl decadienoate plus (E)‐β‐ocimene] or acetic acid used alone or together did not significantly increase the catch of either species in traps with the PH combo lure. The Ajar trap baited with terpinyl acetate and brown sugar (TAS bait) caught significantly more G. molesta than the delta trap baited with PH combo plus acetic acid in California during 2012. The addition of a PH combo lure to an Ajar trap significantly increased catches of G. molesta compared to the use of the TAS bait or PH combo lure alone in 2013. Female G. molesta were caught in TAS‐baited Ajar traps at similar levels with or without the use of additional lures. Ajar traps baited with the TAS bait alone or with (E)‐β‐ocimene and/or PH combo lures caught significantly fewer C. pomonella than delta traps with sex pheromone alone. Ajar traps with 6.4‐mm screened flaps caught similar numbers of total and female G. molesta as similarly baited open Ajar traps, and with a significant reduction in the catch of non‐targets. Broader testing of HPV and PH combo lures for G. molesta in either delta or screened or open Ajar traps is warranted.'})\n",

Studies were conducted to develop a standardized, economical trap for monitoring. Laboratory bioassays found that flies were attracted to dark colours ranging from red to black. Similarly, fly catches in 237‐ml plastic ‘spice’ jars with ten 0.48‐cm holes and baited with apple cider vinegar were significantly higher in jars with red or black than white caps. The use of an alternating set of three, horizontal red, black and red bands (‘Zorro’ trap) significantly increased fly catches compared with the use of all‐red or all‐black strips. This increase was associated with a significantly higher proportion of flies first landing on the side near the openings of the trap instead of on the cap with the ‘Zorro’ trap compared with the other traps. Laboratory data were used to develop a predictive model to define total fly capture as a function of trap colour/colour pattern, cumulative area of entry holes and the length of the trapping portion of the trap. Total fly catches by the ‘Zorro’ trap were compared with other red and clear plastic traps in five field trials conducted in several cultivated and uncultivated sites. Comparisons included a commercial red‐capped 200‐ml trap with two 0.63‐cm holes, an all‐red spice jar with ten 0.48‐cm holes and clear and red 473‐ml and clear 946‐ml plastic cups with six or ten 0.48‐ or 0.63‐cm holes. The model was successfully validated, suggesting that performance of cup traps can be predicted based on a few characteristics. The current ‘Zorro’ trap did not catch most of the flies among trap designs, but showed some advantages, including the durability and potential to recycle the plastic, small size, commercial availability and its greater selectivity for D. suzukii than the other traps tested.'})\n",

Lake Shaman record indicates that the upper Río Cisnes valley was free of ice at around 19 cal ka BP. From this date and until 14.8 cal ka BP, a grass steppe with high proportions of shrubs associated to colder and drier conditions than present developed in this area. A continuous increase of Nothofagus accompanied by a decline in the steppe shrubs and sudden dominance of paludal over aquatic plants from 11 cal ka BP was associated to effective moisture increase but still under modern values. The replacement of the cold-dry grass-shrub steppe by a similar-than-present forest-steppe ecotone suggests an increase in temperature indicating the onset of the Holocene. At the same time, moderate fire activity suggested by the charcoal record could be related to major fuel availability as consequence of Nothofagus forest expansion. Between 8 and 3 cal ka BP, the record indicates the easternmost position of the forest-steppe ecotone suggesting the highest effective moisture with the establishment of seasonality between 5 and 3 cal ka BP. From 3 cal ka BP, the record indicates a retraction of the forest-steppe ecotone accompanied by a high pollen record variability and an increased fire activity. These late changes suggest decreased effective moisture associated with a high climatic variability. At regional and extra-regional scale, climatic changes at Lake Shamans record are mostly associated to changes (latitudinal shifts and/or strengthening/weakening) of past Southern Westerlies that were previously recorded along Patagonia from the Lateglacial to the mid-Holocene. During the Late Holocene, a regional pattern characterized by high record variability emerges throughout Central Chilean Patagonia. This variability would be related to (1) low magnitude Southern Westerlies changes probably associated to ENSO and/or SAM or (2) the complex relationships between vegetation, fire and human occupations during the last 3 cal ka.'})\n",

Warming conditions are strengthened at 10.7 cal kyr BP by the increase of heliophytic taxa (Eucryphia–Caldcluvia) characteristic of the Valdivian rainforest. These heliophytic taxa reach their maximum expansion between 9.6 and 7.4 cal kyr BP and point to warm and dry conditions during the Holocene Climatic Optimum. After 7.4 cal kyr BP, vegetation changes indicate variable climate conditions superimposed on a cooling trend associated with an increase in precipitation after ~ 6–5 cal kyr BP, shown by the expansion of the cold-resistant conifers. During the late Holocene, after 2.8 cal kyr BP, the continuous expansion of cold-resistant conifers marks an increase of cool and wet conditions. The comparison between marine and terrestrial pollen records highlights the similar trends and timing of vegetation changes which allows to complete the regional pattern of vegetation changes around Seno Reloncaví. In comparison with the terrestrial pollen records, this marine pollen record provides a more regional signal of vegetation/climate changes and clearly demonstrates the sensitivity of marine pollen records to past vegetation and climate change.'})\n",

All three estimates consistently and significantly indicated a lower genetic diversity within the peripheral than within the central populations. Genetic differentiation between the two peripheral populations was stronger (FST=0.35) than between central populations at similar spatial scales (FST ranging from 0 to 0.25).

Consequently this practice is used to prevent foliar diseases of grapevines and rots of grapes. In this study, the effects of leaf removal on Cladosporium rot (Cladosporium cladosporioides and Cladosporium herbarum), which often affects ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ in Chile, were characterized. The effects of leaf removal on epiphytic populations of Cladosporium spp. on grape berry surfaces and on Cladosporium rot development were investigated. Three leaf removal treatments were compared: (i) severe leaf removal, where leaves from two to three nodes above, opposite and from all nodes below clusters were removed; (ii) mild leaf removal, where leaves opposite each cluster were removed; and (iii) no leaf removal. Regardless of the leaf removal treatment, low population levels of Cladosporium spp. were detected early in the ontogenic development of grape berries which increased as the berries matured, reaching maximum populations on overripe berries. Based on our results, severe leaf removal favors the growth of Cladosporium spp. on grape berries and increases the prevalence of Cladosporium rot at harvest. This increase in Cladosporium spp. was correlated with an increase in lenticel damage in ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ and ‘Sauvignon blanc’ vines subjected to severe leaf removal. Considering that Cladosporium rot significantly reduces yield and wine quality, farmers should avoid continuous exposure of grape clusters to sunlight in order to prevent severe outbreaks of Cladosporium rot.'})\n",

Recently, the presence of canker and dieback symptoms has been observed along the productive blueberry zone of Chile. Species of Pestalotiopsis and Truncatella were consistently isolated from diseased samples in 22 different locations. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify and characterize the species of Pestalotiopsis and Truncatella associated with canker and twig dieback symptoms on blueberry. Forty-nine isolates were obtained on acidified potato dextrose agar in 2006 and 2007. These isolates were identified as Pestalotiopsis clavispora, P. neglecta, and Truncatella (=Pestalotia) angustata on the basis of colony characteristics and conidial morphology. This identification was verified by internal transcribed spacer analysis of DNA. Isolates of P. clavispora, P. neglecta, and T. angustata were pathogenic on apple, kiwifruit, and blueberry fruit. Similarly, isolates of P. clavispora were pathogenic on detached blueberry twigs of cv. ONeal. Additionally, three selected isolates of P. clavispora induced light-brown canker lesions, surrounded by a reddish halo, and shoot dieback after twig inoculations on 2-year-old twigs of blueberry cvs. ONeal, Bluecrop, Brightwell, Brigitta, Duke, Elliot, and Misty. Among blueberry cultivars, Brightwell and ONeal were the most susceptible and Bluecrop and Misty the least susceptible, while Elliot, Brigitta, and Duke were moderately susceptible to P. clavispora. These pathogens were isolated consistently from inoculated plants, confirming Kochs postulates. P. clavispora was highly sensitive to fludioxonil and pyraclostrobin with a median effective concentration of 0.06 to 0.08 and 0.04 to 0.8 μg/ml, respectively. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that P. clavispora, P. neglecta, and T. angustata are primary pathogens that can cause canker lesions and dieback symptoms on blueberry not previously described in Chile. However, these results do not exclude that other species of these genera or other plant-pathogenic fungi (e.g., Botryosphaeria, Pestalotia, and Phomopsis spp.) may eventually be involved in this syndrome of blueberry'})     \n",

This disease was especially prevalent on Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) vineyards in central Chile where disease incidence commonly comprised 50 to 100% of the clusters at harvest. Symptoms appeared on mature grapes (total soluble solids [TSS] >22%) and were characterized by berry dehydration, a firm decay affecting a small portion of the berry and a superficial olive-green mold. Isolations made on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA) consistently yielded olive-green colonies after 7 days at 20°C. On the basis of colony morphology and morphological characteristics of conidiophores and conidia, Cladosporium herbarum (Pers.:Fr) Link and C. cladosporioides (Fres.) de Vries were identified (1). These species were primarily separated by the presence of rough and smooth conidial surfaces, respectively. Kochs postulates were completed by inoculating 80 wounded mature (20% TSS) CS berries and incubating them at 10, 20, and 30°C. An equal number of wounded but noninoculated berries were left as controls. Berries were surface sterilized (75% ethanol for 30 s and 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for 60 s), inoculated with 10 μl of a 106 conidial suspension per ml applied to the wounds made with a sterile hypodermic needle. Dark, necrotic lesions, 1 to 6 mm in diameter, and a dark mycelial colony appeared on the surface after 7 days in chambers with relative humidity of >95%. Disease incidence was significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by temperature, with 90, 100, and 49% of inoculated berries becoming infected when incubated at 10, 20, or 30°C, respectively. C. herbarum and C. cladosporioides appeared to be equally pathogenic, producing symptoms similar to naturally infected CS berries, and were reisolated (100%) on APDA. These same isolates were pathogenic when tested on mature (TSS >16%) Thompson Seedless (TS) berries. Fungicide sensitivity tests were performed on detached TS berries challenged by placing 10 μl of a 106 conidial suspension per ml of C. herbarum on injured berries. Boscalid (0.5 mg/ml, Cantus WG; BASF, Santiago, Chile), iprodione (0.5 mg/ml, Rovral WP; Bayer Crop Science, Santiago, Chile), pyraclostrobin (0.085 mg/ml, Comet SC; BASF), and pyraclostrobin (0.009 mg/ml) mixed with boscalid at 0.017 mg/ml (Bellis WG; BASF) provided a significant control (P < 0.05) with efficacy between 84.3 and 95.9%.

Al tolerant and Al sensitive cultivars showed different sensitivities to Al toxicity. Interestingly, linear associations were found between grain yield or above-ground biomass and soil Al concentration in Al-sensitive (R2 = 0.95 p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.90 p < 0.001, respectively) and Al-tolerant (R2 = 0.91 p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.88 p < 0.001, respectively) cultivars. Soil Al concentration was found to have a much lower effect on the harvest index. A close, and unique, association was found for both cultivars between grain yield and above-ground biomass (R2 = 0.98 p < 0.001). Root biomass also showed a linear relationship with soil Al concentrations in both Al-sensitive (R2 = 0.96 p < 0.001) and Al-tolerant (R2 = 0.77 p < 0.001) cultivars. Root traits showed good relationships with both grain yield and above-ground biomass.'})\n",
